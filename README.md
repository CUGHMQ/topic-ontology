Thematic ontology of scientific data on the earth surface system(ESS)

Unlike the focus of thematic content on computing the correlation between data, the emphasis on thematic categories lies in determining the hierarchical relationships of data categories, primarily through the computation of thematic terms. Due to the use of different metadata standards across various Earth system data sources, the association relationships between thematic terms are challenging to determine accurately. Therefore, conversion is necessary to precisely compute the thematic relationships between them. Hence, establishing a benchmark thematic ontology to map heterogeneous thematic terms is crucial.

The Global Change Master Directory (GCMD)  is a comprehensive Earth science data ontology directory that plays an important role in scientific data sharing. Existing studies predominantly rely on this ontology for computation, but the large scale of GCMD limits its applicability to Earth system science data. As a result, constructing a domain-specific data ontology is more suitable. Therefore, this study focuses on the development and construction of an Earth system science data thematic term ontology, based on four major categories of data sources: domain-specific authoritative thematic term dictionaries (e.g., GCMD), domain-specific authoritative monographs (e.g., "Geographic Dictionary," "Earth System Research and Scientific Data," "Earth System Science Data Resource System Research," and "Earth System Science Data Integration and Sharing Research: Standard Perspective"), domain ontologies (e.g., SWEET, Semantic Web for Earth and Environmental Terminology), and online comprehensive resources (e.g., Wikipedia and Baidu Encyclopedia).

This research adopts a hybrid approach, combining both top-down and bottom-up methods. On one hand, terms and concepts from the Earth system science data domain are extracted and analyzed from multi-source data using manual collection and web crawling techniques. A thematic term corpus for Earth system science data was collaboratively constructed [88], and a candidate word list was determined. On the other hand, a top-down approach was employed to establish the overall structural framework of the word list, clarifying the structure, classification system, and hierarchical relationships, as well as designing various relationships between candidate terms. Ultimately, a high-quality Earth system science data thematic term ontology was manually constructed, with partial examples shown in Figure 2-8. The ontology specifically includes a 7-level hierarchical structure with a total of 3,810 thematic terms. Under three core themes (near-Earth space layer, land cover layer, and surface mechanism layer), the ontology covers 6 secondary categories and 35 tertiary categories. Within the tertiary categories, it includes 166 subsystem thematic terms, 589 object thematic terms, 2,480 element thematic terms, and 531 attribute thematic terms.
